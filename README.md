Concept: An easy-to-use application to find Rock/Alternative music. We are going to merge multiple API's so all the information will be gathered in a place
so that music enthusiasts of this genre have a centeralized place for all information about the rock scene in Washington State.

Motivation for the project: To fill in a need in this scene to create a website that is specific to the rock / alternative genre. To get people together locally
to find locally to find smaller and bigger artists.

Design Process / Functionailty: We would take three imputs / buttons that have drop down menues that have genre, distance and date. We are going to use that information
to  return informaton using different api's and return relevant information based off the users imput. We are going to use materialize, javascript and css to design the app.
We will start on making our application mobile ready and branch outwards to web application ready on a desktop / laptop.

Future Deveopment: Expand the locator for google maps to include the west coast and potentially other genres.
